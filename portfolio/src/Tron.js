            <h1>Tron</h1>
            <p>Tron is a game that I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a two player game where each player uses the arrow keys to control their respective light cycle. The goal of the game is to avoid the walls and the other player's light cycle. The game is over when one of the players crashes into a wall or the other player's light cycle. The game is also over when the players collide with each other. The game is won when one of the players is the last one standing. The game is a work in progress and I plan to add more features to it in the future.</p>
